# Kalista Wayt - Ph.D. Student

Kalista's main research interests lie in PTA noise analyses, specifically focusing on the true origins of intrinsic red noise. She is trying to determine how spin noise is varies across the MSPs using various computational and analytic tools. However, her true skill set lies in sketching little logos for projects and B-day scheming. If she's not in the office you can probably catch her at home spending time with her cat or playing board games.
