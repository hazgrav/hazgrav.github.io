The hazgrav research group, headed by [Dr. Jeffrey Hazboun](https://jeffreyhazboun.github.io/), is a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Graviational Waves ([NANOGrav](nanograv.org)) scientific collaboration. Comprising a collaborative network of astrophysicists and astronomers, NANOGrav is dedicated to exploring the universe's most enigmatic phenomena through the study of pulsars.

Pulsars, celestial objects emitting regular pulses of radiation, serve as cosmic timekeepers. NANOGrav leverages the precision of these pulsars to detect and analyze gravitational wavesâ€”ripples in spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive celestial objects.

By harnessing nanohertz frequencies, NANOGrav aims to unlock the secrets of astrophysical systems, contributing invaluable insights into the nature of black holes, neutron stars, and the fabric of the cosmos itself. This collaborative effort brings together experts from various institutions, fostering innovation, discovery, and a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces shaping our universe.

Embark on a cosmic journey with NANOGrav as we probe the gravitational symphony of the cosmos, one nanohertz at a time.
