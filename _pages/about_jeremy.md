 Jeremy is a 3rd year grad student at Oregon State University where he works with Dr. Hazboun on detector characterization and interstellar medium mitigation. Jeremy is currently co-leading the NANOGrav 15 year custom noise project. He is also interested in detector tuning and sensitivity forecasting.

 Jeremy previously worked with Dr. Les Wade and Dr. Madeline Wade in the Kenyon College LIGO Lab on parameterized neutron star equation of state models and searches for gravitational wave scattering.

 When he is not in the office, Jeremy enjoys trail running in the OSU research forest and thinking about the pulsar term.
